Please examine the "Cover Image PRD and SDD" markdown file, and implement:

**Storage Strategy:**

- ✅ **Supabase Storage** (not PostgreSQL BYTEA) - purpose-built for images
- ✅ Built-in CDN for fast delivery
- ✅ Completely **FREE** for up to 1,000 books (~100MB)
- ✅ Automatic caching and optimization

**Three Ways to Add Covers:**

1. **Automatic** - From ISBN scan (downloads from Open Library/Google Books)
2. **Photo Library** - Select existing photo
3. **Camera** - Take a picture of the book cover

**Complete Implementation:**

- `CoverImageService.swift` - Handles upload/download/delete/caching
- `ImagePickerView.swift` - Photo library + camera capture
- Updated all book views to display covers
- Thumbnail (50x75) in lists, full size (600x900) in detail view
- NSCache for performance (100 images in memory)
- Image compression (JPEG 0.8 quality, resized to 600x900)

**Database Changes:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE books ADD COLUMN cover_url TEXT;
```

**File Structure:**

```
book-covers/
  └── {user_id}/
      └── {book_id}.jpg
```

**Security:**

- Users can only upload/delete their own covers
- All covers publicly readable (for future sharing features)
- Row Level Security policies included

**User Experience:**

- Seamless integration with ISBN scanner
- "Add/Change/Remove Cover" buttons
- Loading states and error handling
- Automatic cleanup when book is deleted

**Cost:** $0/month for personal use (stays in free tier)

Ready to implement! Want me to help with any specific part or explain any of the code in more detail?

Using the PRD and SDD provided in the "ISBN Scanning and Lookup" markdown file, please implement the following:

**API Recommendation:**

- ✅ **Open Library API** (primary) - Free, unlimited, run by Internet Archive
- ✅ **Google Books API** (fallback) - Free, 1000 requests/day
- Total cost: **$0/month**

**Technical Approach:**

- Uses Apple's built-in **Vision framework** (free, no external dependencies)
- Automatically detects ISBN-13 and ISBN-10 barcodes
- Real-time camera scanning with visual overlay
- Complete working code samples for all components

**User Flow:**

1. Tap "Scan ISBN" button
2. Point camera at barcode (auto-detects)
3. See book preview with cover, title, author
4. Select shelf and confirm
5. Book added to database

**Complete Code Included:**

1. `ISBNService.swift` - API client with Open Library + Google Books fallback
2. `ISBNScannerView.swift` - Camera view with Vision framework barcode detection
3. `BookPreviewView.swift` - Preview before saving
4. Integration code for `ShelfDetailView`

**What You Need to Do:**

1. Add camera permission to Info.plist
2. Copy the 4 code files into your project
3. Test with real ISBN barcodes

The Vision framework handles all the heavy lifting for barcode detection - it's built into iOS and works great for ISBN barcodes (EAN-13 format). No external scanning libraries needed!
